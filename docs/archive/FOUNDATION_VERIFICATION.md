# Foundation Verification Complete

## Test Coverage Summary

We now have **87 comprehensive tests** covering all game rules and edge cases:

### Core Rules Tests (54 tests)
- Card matching and play validation
- Ace suit nominations (NOT wild cards)
- Attack and counter mechanics (2s, Black/Red Jacks)
- Skip mechanics with 7s
- Direction reversal with Queens
- Stacking rules for same-rank cards
- Mandatory play enforcement
- Next player calculation

### Edge Cases Tests (28 tests)
- **Deck Exhaustion**: Reshuffling during draws, massive attacks exceeding deck size
- **Multiple Aces**: Nomination changes, stacking behavior
- **Skip Chains**: Wrapping around table, counter opportunities
- **2-Player Games**: Direction reversal equivalence, skip mechanics
- **Maximum Hand Size**: Drawing 50+ cards from stacked attacks
- **Complex Stacking**: Mixed Red/Black Jacks, full 4-card stacks
- **Suit Nominations**: Clearing after turn, Ace-on-Ace plays
- **Attack Stacking**: Type restrictions, accumulation
- **Game Ending**: Winner handling, last card effects
- **Concurrent Actions**: Turn validation, card ownership

### Additional Test Coverage (5 tests)
- Binary protocol encoding/decoding
- Deck shuffling and dealing
- Game state initialization
- Error handling

## Key Validations

✅ **Aces are NOT wild cards** - must match suit/rank before nomination
✅ **Players get their turn after drawing from attacks**
✅ **7s can counter skips (mandatory play applies)**
✅ **Multiple Red Jacks can counter Black Jacks**
✅ **Suit nominations clear after turn advances**
✅ **Proper modulo handling for negative indices**
✅ **Draw/reshuffle mechanics handle edge cases**
✅ **All special card effects work exactly as documented**

## Implementation Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed Integer.mod for proper negative number handling** in next_player_index
2. **Added proper return values** for play_cards and draw_cards functions
3. **Improved draw_with_reshuffle** to handle deck exhaustion gracefully
4. **Ensured mandatory play rule** applies to skip counters

## Next Steps

The foundation is now rock solid. We can confidently proceed with:
1. GenServer for game state management
2. LiveView UI implementation  
3. AI opponents
4. Binary protocol server (port 1982)
5. Production deployment

All game rules are correctly implemented and thoroughly tested.
