# Rachel Web - TODO List

## Summary
The Rachel card game web implementation is functionally complete with all core game mechanics working correctly. User authentication has been implemented with both web and API endpoints for future mobile app integration. All 328 tests are passing.

## Completed ‚úÖ
- Core game engine with all Rachel rules implemented correctly
- All special cards working (2s draw 2, 7s skip, Black Jacks draw 5, Red Jacks cancel, Queens reverse, Aces nominate)
- Card stacking mechanics
- AI players with multiple difficulty levels and personalities
- Game state management with GenServer
- Turn validation and anti-cheating measures
- WebSocket real-time updates via Phoenix LiveView
- Game over detection and winner celebrations
- Sound effects for all game actions
- User authentication system with:
  - Magic link (passwordless) login
  - Username and display name support
  - Game statistics tracking fields
  - API authentication with Bearer tokens
  - RESTful API endpoints for mobile apps
- Test coverage (328 tests, all passing)

## MUST Have (Priority 1) - Already Verified ‚úÖ
- [x] Game rooms/lobbies - Working via GameManager.create_lobby()
- [x] Anti-cheating measures - Turn validation enforced server-side

## SHOULD Have (Priority 2) üìã
- [ ] **Polish UI/UX** - Add animations, improve mobile responsiveness, enhance visual feedback
- [ ] **Game tutorials/onboarding** - Interactive tutorial for new players to learn the rules
- [ ] **Integrate user accounts with game system** - Connect authenticated users to their game sessions
- [ ] **Update game components to use authenticated users** - Modify LiveView components to use user data

## COULD Have (Priority 3) üí≠
- [ ] **Persistent game state** - Save/resume games across sessions
- [ ] **Spectator mode** - Allow users to watch ongoing games
- [ ] **Chat system** - In-game chat for multiplayer games
- [ ] **Game statistics and leaderboards** - Track and display player rankings
- [ ] **Game replays/history** - View past games and moves

## WOULD Be Nice (Priority 4) üåü
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Optimize for games with many players
- [ ] **Tournament/bracket system** - Organize competitive tournaments
- [ ] **Card game variations** - Implement house rules and variants
- [ ] **Mobile app development** - Native iOS/Android apps using the API

## Technical Debt & Improvements üîß
- [ ] Remove unused aliases and clean up warnings
- [ ] Add proper error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Add monitoring and telemetry
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add deployment configuration (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- [ ] Implement WebSocket authentication for LiveView
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Next Steps üöÄ
1. **Immediate priority**: Integrate the user authentication system with the game engine so that games track authenticated players rather than string names
2. **Quick wins**: Polish the UI with better animations and mobile support
3. **User experience**: Add tutorial system to help new players learn the game
4. **Long term**: Consider native mobile apps once the web version is polished

## Notes üìù
- The game engine is rock-solid with comprehensive test coverage
- Authentication system is ready for both web and mobile clients
- Binary protocol implementation exists for efficient mobile communication
- Sound system is fully integrated with all game events
- The codebase is well-structured and ready for production deployment

## How to Resume Development
1. Start Phoenix server: `mix phx.server`
2. Run tests: `mix test`
3. Check this TODO list for next tasks
4. Focus on integrating user accounts with the game system as the next major milestone
