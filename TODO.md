# Rachel Web - TODO List

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (UI/UX Polish Phase)

## Summary
The Rachel card game web implementation is **production-ready and deployed** to Fly.io. All core functionality, security, and infrastructure are complete.

**Current Focus:** âœ¨ **Visual Feedback & Polish**

**Status:** âœ… All 424 tests passing | âœ… Deployed to production | âœ… Phase 1 & 2 complete
**Next Priority:** Loading states, toast notifications, and enhanced visual feedback

## Completed âœ…
- Core game engine with all Rachel rules implemented correctly
- All special cards working (2s draw 2, 7s skip, Black Jacks draw 5, Red Jacks cancel, Queens reverse, Aces nominate)
- Card stacking mechanics
- AI players with multiple difficulty levels and personalities
- Game state management with GenServer
- Turn validation and anti-cheating measures
- WebSocket real-time updates via Phoenix LiveView
- Game over detection and winner celebrations
- Sound effects for all game actions
- **ðŸ”’ Authentication required for all game routes** (prevents bot attacks/resource abuse)
- User authentication system with:
  - Magic link (passwordless) login
  - Username and display name support
  - Game statistics tracking fields
  - API authentication with Bearer tokens
  - RESTful API endpoints for mobile apps
- **ðŸ“œ Minimum viable compliance (2025-10-22):**
  - âœ… Privacy Policy (GDPR/CCPA compliant)
  - âœ… Terms of Service (with abuse prevention clauses)
  - âœ… Account deletion feature (right to be forgotten)
  - âœ… Age verification (13+ COPPA compliance)
  - âœ… Footer with legal links in root layout
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXES (2025-10-21):**
  - âœ… Fixed API authentication crash (tuple pattern match)
  - âœ… Fixed user login crash (nil safety in renew_session)
  - âœ… Added comprehensive API auth tests (4 new tests)
- **SECURITY HARDENING (2025-10-21):**
  - âœ… Rate limiting with Hammer (configurable per endpoint)
  - âœ… Nonce-based CSP headers (eliminates unsafe-inline)
  - âœ… Security headers (X-Frame-Options, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
  - âœ… API authentication with Bearer tokens
- **API INTEGRATION TESTS (2025-10-21):**
  - âœ… 48 comprehensive API tests covering all endpoints
  - âœ… Authentication tests (register, login, logout, me)
  - âœ… Game operation tests (create, join, list, play, draw)
  - âœ… Error handling and edge cases
- **DATABASE INTEGRATION (2025-10-21):**
  - âœ… User-game linking (user_id tracked in players)
  - âœ… Game persistence (save/restore from database)
  - âœ… Game cleanup GenServer (automatic old game removal)
  - âœ… Structured error handling (GameError module)
- **INFRASTRUCTURE (2025-10-21):**
  - âœ… CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
  - âœ… Health check endpoint (/health)
  - âœ… Error tracking (Sentry integration)
  - âœ… Deployed to Fly.io with managed Postgres
  - âœ… Docker containerization
  - âœ… LiveView component extraction
- Test coverage (424 tests, all passing)
