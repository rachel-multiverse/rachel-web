# Rachel Web - TODO List

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21 (Post API Integration Tests)

## Summary
The Rachel card game web implementation is **production-ready** with all core game mechanics, security hardening, comprehensive testing, and deployment infrastructure complete.

**Status:** ✅ All 424 tests passing (376 original + 48 new API integration tests)
**Critical Bugs:** ✅ Fixed
**Security:** ✅ Rate limiting, CSP headers, security headers
**Infrastructure:** ✅ CI/CD, error tracking, health checks, deployed to Fly.io
**Production Ready:** ✅ **READY FOR PRODUCTION**

## Completed ✅
- Core game engine with all Rachel rules implemented correctly
- All special cards working (2s draw 2, 7s skip, Black Jacks draw 5, Red Jacks cancel, Queens reverse, Aces nominate)
- Card stacking mechanics
- AI players with multiple difficulty levels and personalities
- Game state management with GenServer
- Turn validation and anti-cheating measures
- WebSocket real-time updates via Phoenix LiveView
- Game over detection and winner celebrations
- Sound effects for all game actions
- User authentication system with:
  - Magic link (passwordless) login
  - Username and display name support
  - Game statistics tracking fields
  - API authentication with Bearer tokens
  - RESTful API endpoints for mobile apps
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXES (2025-10-21):**
  - ✅ Fixed API authentication crash (tuple pattern match)
  - ✅ Fixed user login crash (nil safety in renew_session)
  - ✅ Added comprehensive API auth tests (4 new tests)
- **SECURITY HARDENING (2025-10-21):**
  - ✅ Rate limiting with Hammer (configurable per endpoint)
  - ✅ Nonce-based CSP headers (eliminates unsafe-inline)
  - ✅ Security headers (X-Frame-Options, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
  - ✅ API authentication with Bearer tokens
- **API INTEGRATION TESTS (2025-10-21):**
  - ✅ 48 comprehensive API tests covering all endpoints
  - ✅ Authentication tests (register, login, logout, me)
  - ✅ Game operation tests (create, join, list, play, draw)
  - ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- **DATABASE INTEGRATION (2025-10-21):**
  - ✅ User-game linking (user_id tracked in players)
  - ✅ Game persistence (save/restore from database)
  - ✅ Game cleanup GenServer (automatic old game removal)
  - ✅ Structured error handling (GameError module)
- **INFRASTRUCTURE (2025-10-21):**
  - ✅ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
  - ✅ Health check endpoint (/health)
  - ✅ Error tracking (Sentry integration)
  - ✅ Deployed to Fly.io with managed Postgres
  - ✅ Docker containerization
  - ✅ LiveView component extraction
- Test coverage (424 tests, all passing)

## MUST Have (Priority 1) - Already Verified ✅
- [x] Game rooms/lobbies - Working via GameManager.create_lobby()
- [x] Anti-cheating measures - Turn validation enforced server-side

## SHOULD Have (Priority 2) 📋
- [x] **Integrate user accounts with game system** - ✅ Connected authenticated users to game sessions
- [x] **Update game components to use authenticated users** - ✅ LiveView components use user data
- [ ] **Polish UI/UX** - Add animations, improve mobile responsiveness, enhance visual feedback
- [ ] **Game tutorials/onboarding** - Interactive tutorial for new players to learn the rules

## COULD Have (Priority 3) 💭
- [x] **Persistent game state** - ✅ Games save/restore from database
- [ ] **Spectator mode** - Allow users to watch ongoing games
- [ ] **Chat system** - In-game chat for multiplayer games
- [ ] **Game statistics and leaderboards** - Track and display player rankings (fields exist, UI needed)
- [ ] **Game replays/history** - View past games and moves

## WOULD Be Nice (Priority 4) 🌟
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Optimize for games with many players
- [ ] **Tournament/bracket system** - Organize competitive tournaments
- [ ] **Card game variations** - Implement house rules and variants
- [ ] **Mobile app development** - Native iOS/Android apps using the API

## Technical Debt & Improvements 🔧
- [x] ✅ Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [x] ✅ Add monitoring and telemetry (Sentry)
- [x] ✅ Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [x] ✅ Add deployment configuration (Docker, Fly.io)
- [x] ✅ Add proper error handling for edge cases (GameError module)
- [ ] Remove unused aliases and clean up warnings
- [ ] Implement WebSocket authentication for LiveView
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Next Steps 🚀
1. **Immediate priority**: Polish UI/UX - animations, mobile responsiveness, visual feedback
2. **User experience**: Add tutorial system to help new players learn the game
3. **Statistics UI**: Display user stats (games_played, games_won, etc.) on profile
4. **Long term**: Consider native mobile apps - API is ready for mobile clients

## Notes 📝
- **Production Status**: ✅ App is deployed and production-ready
- **Test Coverage**: 424 tests all passing, comprehensive API and game engine coverage
- **Security**: Rate limiting, CSP headers, security headers, error tracking all in place
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD, health checks, database backups, Docker containerization
- **Game Engine**: Rock-solid with all Rachel rules implemented correctly
- **Authentication**: Full web + API auth with Bearer tokens for mobile apps
- **Database**: User-game linking, game persistence, automatic cleanup
- **Monitoring**: Sentry error tracking, /health endpoint, Fly.io metrics

## How to Resume Development
1. **Start server**: `mix phx.server` (visit http://localhost:4000)
2. **Run tests**: `mix test` (should see 424 passing)
3. **Deploy**: `fly deploy` (already configured)
4. **Focus area**: UI/UX polish - animations, mobile responsiveness, visual feedback
